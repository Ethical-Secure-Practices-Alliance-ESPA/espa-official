## Support ESPA

The **Ethical & Secure Practices Alliance (ESPA)** exists to provide clear, practical guidance on ethical and secure practices — free from advertising, tracking, or commercial influence.

All of ESPA’s **core guides are available at no cost**.  
Supporter contributions help ensure this work can continue sustainably and independently.

---

## Why Support Matters

Creating and maintaining high-quality guidance takes time and care.  
Support from the community helps ESPA cover essential costs such as:

- Secure hosting and infrastructure  
- Domain registration and renewal  
- Research and documentation time  
- Security tooling and audits  
- Future public guides and updates  

ESPA does **not** accept advertising, affiliate links, or data monetization.  
Supporters make it possible to remain independent.

---

## What Supporters Enable

Supporters help make possible:

- Continued publication of **free public guides**
- Development of **advanced and in-depth resources**
- Ongoing maintenance and updates
- A privacy-respecting, tracker-free website

Support does **not** affect access to existing public content.

---

## Supporter Resources (Coming Later)

In the future, ESPA plans to publish **advanced, implementation-focused guides** intended for supporters.  
These may include deeper technical material and long-form research that goes beyond introductory guidance.

All essential ethical and security fundamentals will remain public.

---

## Current Status

ESPA is an **early-stage association in formation**.

We are currently finalizing:
- Legal registration
- A dedicated organizational account for donations
- Transparent accounting workflows

Once these are in place, optional supporter contributions will be opened through a privacy-respecting platform.

---

## Our Commitment to Transparency

- Core guidance will remain free and publicly accessible  
- Contributions will be used solely for ESPA-related expenses  
- Any surplus will be reserved for future operational and research costs  
- No personal profit, advertising, or data exploitation
