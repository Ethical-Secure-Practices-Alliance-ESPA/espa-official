### Ethics First

Security practices should minimize harm, respect individual autonomy, and avoid coercive or fear-driven approaches.

Guidance should be understandable and usable by people without formal technical backgrounds.

Content avoids vendor bias, regional favoritism, and unnecessary ideological framing.
