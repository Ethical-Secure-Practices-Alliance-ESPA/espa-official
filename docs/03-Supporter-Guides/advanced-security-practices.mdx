# Advanced Security Practices

This guide is designed for ESPA supporters who want to strengthen their ethical and security practices beyond the basics.  
It combines practical steps, ethical considerations, and references to authoritative sources.

> **Note:** This guide assumes readers already understand foundational practices covered in [Foundations of Ethics & Security](../02-Public-Guides/ethics-and-security-basics.md).

## Identity & Access Management {#identity-access-management}

Proper IAM reduces the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.

- **Strong, unique credentials:** Use a password manager to generate and store high-entropy passwords. According to [NIST SP 800-63B](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html), long passphrases with randomization are more secure than complex character substitutions.  

- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA):** Prefer hardware-based security keys (FIDO2) over SMS MFA, which can be intercepted. [OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet, 2023](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html)  

- **Role-based access control (RBAC):** Limit permissions to only what users or devices need to perform their tasks. This follows the *principle of least privilege*, recommended by [CIS Controls v8](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/cis-controls-list/)  

- **Regular audits:** Periodically review account access and privileges. Remove unused accounts promptly to reduce attack surface.

<TooltipBox title="MFA" domain="iam">
Multi-factor authentication is an extra verification step beyond username/password, such as an authenticator app or hardware key.
</TooltipBox>

<TooltipBox title="RBAC" domain="iam">
Role-Based Access Control; organizes users into roles with predefined access levels to reduce risk.
</TooltipBox>

<TooltipBox title="Principle of Least Privilege" domain="iam">
Users or systems are granted only the access necessary for their roles. This minimizes damage if an account or device is compromised.
</TooltipBox>

## Network Security (Home & Work) {#network-security}

Securing networks is essential for individuals and organizations.

- **DNS & Filtering:** Use privacy-respecting DNS services, e.g., [Quad9](https://www.quad9.net/), which blocks known malicious domains.  
- **Segmentation:** Separate IoT, guest, and sensitive devices on different network segments.  
- **Firewalls & Monitoring:** Enable firewalls and monitor traffic for unusual patterns.  
- **Patch Management:** Keep all routers, firmware, and devices updated with security patches.  

<TooltipBox title="Network Segmentation" domain="network">
Dividing a network into zones to isolate devices and reduce potential attack surfaces.
</TooltipBox>

<TooltipBox title="Patch Management" domain="network">
Regularly updating software, firmware, and systems to fix security vulnerabilities.
</TooltipBox>

<TooltipBox title="Privacy-Respecting DNS" domain="network">
A DNS resolver that blocks malicious domains and does not log or sell user data.
</TooltipBox>

## Data Protection & Encryption {#data-protection-encryption}

Protecting sensitive data is critical for privacy and ethical responsibility.

- **Encryption at rest:** Store sensitive data encrypted on devices and servers.  
- **Encryption in transit:** Use HTTPS/TLS for all communications.  
- **Secure Backups:** Keep multiple copies in physically separated or encrypted storage.  
- **Least-privilege sharing:** Only share documents with necessary parties.

<TooltipBox title="Encryption at Rest" domain="data">
Encrypting stored data so it cannot be accessed by unauthorized parties.
</TooltipBox>

<TooltipBox title="Encryption in Transit" domain="data">
Encrypting data while it is being transmitted over networks to prevent interception.
</TooltipBox>

<TooltipBox title="Secure Backup" domain="data">
Maintaining multiple copies of critical data in different physical or encrypted locations to prevent loss.
</TooltipBox>

## Ethical Digital Practices {#ethical-digital-practices}

Security is inseparable from ethics.

- **Tool Evaluation:** Avoid services that exploit user data or violate consent.  
- **Transparency:** Document team decisions, policies, and access rights.  
- **Responsible Sharing:** Respect others’ data and privacy.  
- **Education:** Train yourself and your team continuously.

<TooltipBox title="Ethical Digital Practices" domain="ethics">
Principles and actions that ensure technology is used responsibly, respecting privacy, consent, and fairness.
</TooltipBox>

<TooltipBox title="Transparency" domain="ethics">
Being clear and open about data use, decisions, and practices within an organization or community.
</TooltipBox>

---

## Continuous Review & Improvement {#continuous-review-improvement}

Ethics and security evolve constantly. Adopt a mindset of continuous improvement:

- Schedule periodic audits for systems, access, and policies  
- Track changes, incidents, and lessons learned  
- Update practices based on emerging threats or standards  
- Encourage a culture of reflection, not blame

<TooltipBox title="Continuous Improvement" domain="ethics">
Ongoing process of evaluating and enhancing security and ethical practices to adapt to evolving risks.
</TooltipBox>

- Apply advanced privacy-focused security measures  
- Build a sustainable foundation for ethical digital operations  
- Foster trust and reliability within their networks and communities
