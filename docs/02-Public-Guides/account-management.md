### Personal Accounts vs Organizational Accounts

**Personal Accounts**  
- Accounts for email, social media, banking, and devices at home.  
- Focus is on **privacy, strong passwords, and device security**.  

**Organizational Accounts**  
- Accounts for boards, small teams, or collaborative environments.  
- Focus is on **access control, role management, auditing, and secure collaboration**.  

- **Access Control** ensures only authorized users can access specific accounts or resources.

- **Role Management** defines what actions each user can perform based on their role in an organization.

This introduction sets the stage for **step-by-step account management practices**, tailored for both personal and organizational contexts.

## Account Creation & Setup

Creating accounts securely from the start is critical. Proper setup reduces risk and makes ongoing management easier.

### Personal Accounts

1. **Use unique usernames and passwords** for each account.  
2. Enable **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** wherever possible.  
3. Set up **recovery options** (email or phone number) for account recovery.  
4. Choose strong, memorable passwords — consider using a **password manager** to store them securely.

An extra layer of security requiring a second verification step, such as a text message or authentication app.

<TooltipBox title="Password Manager" domain="security">
A secure tool that stores and encrypts your passwords, so you only need to remember one master password.

### Organizational Accounts

1. **Assign accounts based on roles** — only give permissions required for the user’s tasks.  
2. Use **shared password vaults** or **enterprise password managers** to securely share credentials.  
3. Require **2FA for all users** to reduce unauthorized access risks.  
4. Set **account expiration or review dates** for temporary users or contractors.

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
A system for assigning permissions to users based on their role to limit access to only what is necessary.

> **Tip:** Always verify new accounts immediately after creation to ensure they work correctly and all security measures are active.

## Account Maintenance & Monitoring

Creating accounts is only the first step — maintaining them properly ensures ongoing security and prevents unauthorized access.

### Personal Accounts

1. **Regularly update passwords** every few months, especially for sensitive accounts.  
2. Review connected devices and active sessions; log out of any you don’t recognize.  
3. Check recovery information (email, phone number) and update as needed.  
4. Keep software and apps updated to reduce vulnerabilities.

2. Remove or deactivate accounts that are no longer needed (e.g., former employees or temporary contractors).  
3. Monitor login activity and set alerts for unusual behavior.  
4. Enforce strong password policies and require 2FA for all accounts.
