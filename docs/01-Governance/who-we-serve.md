ESPA is dedicated to supporting **two main groups** of users: **home users** and **NGOs/Organizations**. Our mission is to provide practical, actionable, and ethical guidance to help each group navigate digital security, privacy, and ethical technology practices.

### Home Users

Home users include individuals, families, or anyone managing technology for personal use. Our documentation provides clear, step-by-step guidance on topics such as network security, account management, privacy, and secure storage.  

Home users can expect:  
- Easy-to-follow explanations that make complex concepts approachable.  
- Actionable steps to improve personal digital safety immediately.  
- Guidance that empowers them to make informed decisions about the tools and services they use.  

By following ESPA’s public guides, home users become part of a **larger community** committed to ethical and secure practices. Later, if they choose, they can support ESPA by accessing **supporter-funded advanced guides**, helping us continue to produce free, high-quality resources.

### NGOs / Organizations

NGOs, non-profits, and other organizations face unique challenges in digital security and data protection. ESPA’s documentation helps these groups:  

- Implement organizational privacy and security practices.  
- Manage sensitive data responsibly.  
- Train team members on ethical and secure technology practices.  

Our guides provide **general guidance** designed to be applicable across a variety of organizations. Employees and members should always follow **their organization’s specific policies**, while using ESPA’s documentation as a framework for improving security and privacy practices.

By engaging with ESPA’s resources, NGOs and organizations contribute to a **culture of ethical and secure technology**, and those who later choose to support ESPA through advanced guides help ensure that these resources remain free, updated, and widely available.
